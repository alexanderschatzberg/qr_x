You\\'re just trying to get some\\ndata out of it. Beautiful Soup is here to help. Since 2004, it\\'s been\\nsaving programmers hours or days of work on quick-turnaround\\nscreen scraping projects.</p>\\n\\n<p>Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround\\nprojects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\n<li>Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms\\nfor navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for\\ndissecting a document and extracting what you need. It doesn\\'t take\\nmuch code to write an application\\n\\n<li>Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to\\nUnicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don\\'t have to think\\nabout encodings, unless the document doesn\\'t specify an encoding and\\nBeautiful Soup can\\'t detect one. Then you just have to specify the\\noriginal encoding.\\n\\n<li>Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like <a\\nhref=\"http://lxml.de/\">lxml</a> and <a\\nhref=\"http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/\">html5lib</a>, allowing you\\nto try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for\\nflexibility.\\n\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree\\ntraversal stuff for you. You can tell it \"Find all the links\", or\\n\"Find all the links of class <tt>externalLink</tt>\", or \"Find all the\\nlinks whose urls match \"foo.com\", or \"Find the table heading that\\'s\\ngot bold text, then give me that text.\"\\n\\n<p>Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites\\nis now within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take\\nonly minutes with Beautiful Soup.\\n\\n<p>Interested? <a href=\"bs4/doc/\">Read more.</a>\\n\\n<h3>Getting and giving support</h3>\\n\\n<div id=\"tidelift\" align=\"center\">\\n<a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-beautifulsoup4?utm_source=pypi-beautifulsoup4&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise\" target=\"_blank\">\\n <span class=\"cta\">\\n  Beautiful Soup for enterprise available via Tidelift\\n </span>\\n</a>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>If you have questions, send them to <a\\nhref=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/beautifulsoup\">the discussion\\ngroup</a>.

If it\\'s a security vulnerability, report it confidentially through <a href=\"https://tidelift.com/security\">Tidelift</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you use Beautiful Soup as part of your work, please consider a <a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-beautifulsoup4?utm_source=pypi-beautifulsoup4&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=website\">Tidelift subscription</a>. This will support many of the free software projects your organization depends on, not just Beautiful Soup.\\n\\n\\n<p>If Beautiful Soup is useful to you on a personal level, you might like to read <a href=\"zine/\"><i>Tool Safety</i></a>, a short zine I wrote about what I learned about software development from working on Beautiful Soup.

You can install Beautiful Soup 4 with\\n<code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code>.\\n\\n<p>In Debian and Ubuntu, Beautiful Soup is available as the\\n<code>python3-bs4</code> package. In Fedora it\\'s\\navailable as the <code>python3-beautifulsoup4</code> package.\\n\\n<p>Beautiful Soup is licensed under the MIT license, so you can also\\ndownload the tarball, drop the <code>bs4/</code> directory into almost\\nany Python application (or into your library path) and start using it\\nimmediately.\\n\\n<p>Beautiful Soup 4 is supported on Python versions 3.6 and\\ngreater. Support for Python 2 was discontinued on January 1, 2021&mdash;one\\nyear after the Python 2 sunsetting date.\\n\\n<h3>Beautiful Soup 3</h3>\\n\\n<p>Beautiful Soup 3 was the official release line of Beautiful Soup\\nfrom May 2006 to March 2012. It does not support Python 3 and was\\ndiscontinued or January 1, 2021&mdash;one year after the Python 2\\nsunsetting date. If you have any active projects using Beautiful Soup\\n3, you should migrate to Beautiful Soup 4 as part of your Python 3\\nconversion.\\n\\n<p><a\\nhref=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs3/documentation.html\">Here\\'s\\nthe Beautiful Soup 3 documentation.</a>\\n\\n<p>The current and hopefully final release of Beautiful Soup 3 is <a\\nhref=\"download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.2.2.tar.gz\">3.2.2</a> (October 5,\\n2019). It\\'s the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package on pip. It\\'s also\\navailable as <code>python-beautifulsoup</code> in Debian and Ubuntu,\\nand as <code>python-BeautifulSoup</code> in Fedora.\\n\\n<p>Once Beautiful Soup 3 is discontinued, these package names will be available for use by a more recent version of Beautiful Soup.\\n\\n<p>Beautiful Soup 3, like Beautiful Soup 4, is <a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-beautifulsoup?utm_source=pypi-beautifulsoup&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=website\">supported through Tidelift</a>.</p>\\n\\n<a name=\"HallOfFame\"><h2>Hall of Fame</h2></a>\\n\\n<p>Over the years, Beautiful Soup has been used in hundreds of\\ndifferent projects.
